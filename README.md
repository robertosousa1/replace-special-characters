# **Replace Special Characters**

In a validation of a very large text, there may be cases in which a word is null or undefined. To prevent this validation from being done manually, our lib is able to do it together with the normalization of the text.

 ## Install

    $ npm install replace-special-characters
or

    $ yarn add replace-special-characters

## Usage

```js
const replaceSpecialCharacters = require('replace-special-characters');

const normalizedString = replaceSpecialCharacters('JÃ¤vÃ¡SÃ§rÃ®pt');
//=> 'JavaScript'
```
